_This website is almost one year old. Sure, there've been some minor additions of features here and there. But for the first time ever, we are launching a_ ___Brand New Feature!___ _I'm proud to introduce_ ___Categories___, _a way to sort posts!_

You will notice that there is a new item in the menu entitled "Categories." As the name suggests, it links to a collection of buttons labeled with each category's name. Clicking any of the buttons on that page will take you to the complete list of posts in that category. Please try out this method of browsing through posts at least once; I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

Not only that, but each post's category is displayed along with it, even on the home page. This means that you can read more posts of the same type if that is your desire. Clicking a category's name will always bring you to that category's list of posts. So if, for example, you're reading the post [Glitch Effect](/glitch), you can click on CodePen on the right to bring you to the list of all posts about CodePen. As of me writing this there should only be one. _(We really do need to write more posts about CodePen...)_

I hope you like this added functionality. Please feel free to use this feature however you want. Whether it would be to gaze at the wonderful [CSS stuff](/categories/css-madness) or to be bamboozled by the [weird posts](/categories/wideweirdweb), I won't judge. As long as you enjoy yourself, I'll be happy knowing that people use and like something that I made.
