_There's nothing quite as enjoyable as looking over someones body of work, especially over a large period of time._

[Matt Deslauriers](http://mattdesl.svbtle.com/) has done some seriously impressive javascript work over the past 6 months, all covered in this nice [wrap up blog post](http://mattdesl.svbtle.com/some-javascript-sketches).

Thats some really creative, inspiring and cutting edge stuff!
