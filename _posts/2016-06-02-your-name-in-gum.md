_Studies have shown that gum can help concentration, why not use it to make words?_

To put it _minty_ and simple, Navid Nuur decided to try and shape gum into letters using nothing but his mouth. After learning he could make letters with his mouth, he decided to _stretch_ his limits and make the entire alphabet.<br>
Then, working with [Perceptor](http://perceptor.nl) to set up the _bones_ of the website, and Jhoeko to take the pictures, Navid made this _refreshing_ project.
