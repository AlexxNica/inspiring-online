_Looking for a little color and interaction inspiration? [William Ngan](http://williamngan.com)'s code experiments exploring [point, form and space](http://williamngan.github.io/pt/index.html) are just for you._

The delightful array of experiments goes over curves, lines, particles and more. You can read about it in this informative [Medium](https://medium.com/@williamngan/pt-93382bf5943e) article as well.
