_If you are in the world of web development, then this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HP6k43T0yM) is a must watch!_

Very founder of this project [Tim Holman](http://tholman.com/) delivered a wonderful talk for CSSconf EU in 2015. If you haven't seen it already, you're missing out. Really. Not only you'll discover the fun side of the web, but also might learn how to make you're colleagues life on the web, well, a bit more interesting...

Basically. Relax, enjoy and just have some darn fun :)
