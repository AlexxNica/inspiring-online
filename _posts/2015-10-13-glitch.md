_[This Three.js EffectComposer Glitch](http://codepen.io/ryonakae/full/PPKxyw) by Japanese developer [Ryo Nakae](http://brdr.jp) demonstrates some of the cooler ways you can use shaders to add extra effects to your models._

The demo is built using [Three.js](http://threejs.org), as well as the [EffectComposer](https://github.com/hughsk/three-effectcomposer) plugin. Really, great stuff!
