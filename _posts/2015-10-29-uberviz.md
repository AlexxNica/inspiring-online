_ÜBERVIZ creates custom real-time and audio-reactive music visualizers... using web technologies._

Check out their [cool live demos](http://uberviz.io) and get your own music visualized by dropping an MP3 file into the browser (doesn't work for all demos) or listen to the demo tracks and enjoy the show!

PS: Some demos even support microphone input!
