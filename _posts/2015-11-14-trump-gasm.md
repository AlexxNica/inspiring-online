_Would you ever want to live in the world where Trump isn't running for president? Neither do I._

Cringeworthy little experiment to fill your screen with Trump emotions. It's raining Trump, Hallelujah, it's raining Trump.

Why not stop there, on the theme of Trump, [Paint with Trump](http://paintwithdonaldtrump.com) is another random (and infinitely useful) tool you can use to ... well, paint with Donald Trump's face!

And just for the sake of it, if the 2020 election is more your jam, [Kanye Draw](http://kanyedraw.com) would definitely be what you're looking for.
