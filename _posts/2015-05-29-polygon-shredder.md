_This WebGL experiment does exactly what its name suggests: It shreds polygons._

[The Polygon Shredder](https://www.clicktorelease.com/code/polygon-shredder) turns cubes into colorful confetti. This results in a very cool effect (which is also very graphics card heavy). You can even change some variables and the number of polygons (do **not** choose "INSANE") to customize it. Be sure to check out the amazing forks [The Solitaire Winner](http://alteredqualia.com/tmp/solitaire) and [The Explorer Crasher](http://zz85.github.io/explorer-crasher).
