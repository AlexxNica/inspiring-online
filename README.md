## Inspiring Online
_Inspiring online is an open source blog, used to share interesting, and inspiring things from the online landscape._

### The idea
Inspiring Online aims to be a blog for those looking for encouragement and inspiration in the tech world, but is also an experiment. The entire blog is open source, so anyone can submit amendments to posts, fix spelling mistakes, add discussion links, and create new posts too! Ideally, its a great starting area for someone to enter the open source world!

### What we like
Natrually, for Inspiring Online to keep a good quality, we can't accept any old post. For new people, there should be a bunch of `[proposal]`'s in the projects issues page [link to issues page here] ... these are great starting points. Similarly, if you spot a mistake or problem in a post, you can patch that up too!

We're looking for posts, images and links that inspire people. These can range from

### What we don't like
Sadly, we don't really want everything... we've got to keep the quality up, and some things can taint that.
